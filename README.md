# Assembly-Line-the-game
A Factorio inspired factory game that runs COMPLETELY in the command line, built purely with rust and some some cargo to handle data storage.

# Goals
The goal of this game is for the source code to be easily readable and possible to reverse engineer and moddify to your liking whether it be adding a new building, mechanic, or just changing the color of some text or the aspect ratio for the game to render at. Overall I want this game to not just be a game but a learning tool for aspiring developers of all types to learn from and improve the game.

# For the future
In the future assuming I finish the base game I want to make resources that allow people to more easily understand how the game works and its functions to make it even easier to mod the game. Furthermore I want to also make my own mods or expansions that can be easily added onto the base game.

# Notes
This is my first large-scale programming project its first and foremost meant for me to learn new technologies and network with people online, I want my code to be scrutinized and I want to improve it because this can be a learning experience and a way to make myself a better programmer. furthermore, this is my first project in the rust programming language
